            Week 1 8/21-8/25 <br>
            this week was very fun since the class was split into 2 sides and <br> 
            we experiment with the half pipes and marbles. Each team had to 
            make a track for the marble  and move it to a bucket which was too 
            far away for all the half pipes so we had to run and hand the pipes 
            to people down the line. In the end my team won and it was a good experence
        </p>

            Week 2 8/28-9/1 <br>
            this week we talked about tinker cad and made 3D objects that 
            we would find in our homes. I made a microwave and i would say that 
            it is very good 
            </p>
        </P> Week 3 9/5-9/8
        This week we made tinkercad designs for a rube goldburg machine.
        Then we watched a video on mechanical engineering whcih we took 
        notes on.
        
        </P> Week 4 9/11-9/15
        this week we made our rube goldburg machine with card board. I worked with
        my table which consisted of joe,andrew,evan and me. together we 
        made a good track but we had so many attempts since we did not have 
        enough power for the car to pop the ballon. But in the end we did it
        and it was fun to create.
        
        <p> Week 5 9/18-9/22 <br>
        this week we made boats made out of paper and my design could hold 99.0 <br>
        grams which was a good score in the class but the best was 122 grams<br>
        at the end of class we drew E's and cut them out 
        
        <P> Week 6 9/25-9/29
        This week we dicected a computer with Andrew SInclair. We started by
        taking the cover off and inside it looked so complicated and i thoght
        we could never finish. next we took out everything inside which started 
        with big stuff but then we got down to the wires which were hard to unplug.
        the hardest part was supose to be taking everything out but when 
        we started puting everything back in we realized we had to put something
        under the motherboard so we had to unscrew everything and start over.
        when we were about half way done i had to go to my water polo game 
        but Andrew put it back together and it was super fun and i learn a lot.
        
        <P> Week 7  10/2-10/6
        This week we learned about biomechanics. A big part of biomechanics 
        is prostetics and we learned all about that. next we made a tinkercad 
        design of a prostetic for a animal and i made a leg for a monkey. It was
        very fun and next week we will make a cardboard prostetic hand.
         </p> week 8 10/8-10/12 <br>
         this week i was sick but i learned that we switched seats. 
         then we took a quiz on biomechanics. After that we went over the 
         Aerospace engineering slides and watched a video on space x self landing rocket.
         on thursday we made a tinkercad model of our rocket that we are going to make next week.

</p> week 9 10/24-10/28<br>
I was sick last week so i had to do my tinkercad of my rocked bottle 
on monday but i got that finished so on tuesday I partnered up with dickson
and we bade our model and on thursday we tested our design and it did 
pretty bad and went about 12 feet but it was fun.

        </p> Week 10 10/23-10/27 <br>
        this week we made water filters using rocks pebbles sand and 
        cotton balls. we put all the materials in a plastic bottle,
        it didn't work very well, I belive that it is because there was
        to much sand and it made the water dirty. In the end we did bad but I learned a lot <br>
