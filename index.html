            Week 1 8/21-8/25 <br>
            this week was very fun since the class was split into 2 sides and <br> 
            we experiment with the half pipes and marbles. Each team had to 
            make a track for the marble  and move it to a bucket which was too 
            far away for all the half pipes so we had to run and hand the pipes 
            to people down the line. In the end my team won and it was a good experence
        </p>

        <p>
            Week 2 8/28-9/1 <br>
            this week we talked about tinker cad and made 3D objects that 
            we would find in our homes. I made a microwave and i would say that 
            it is very good 
            </p>
        </P> Week 3 9/5-9/8
        This week we made tinkercad designs for a rube goldburg machine.
        Then we watched a video on mechanical engineering whcih we took 
        notes on.
        
        </P> Week 4 9/11-9/15
        this week we made our rube goldburg machine with card board. I worked with
        my table which consisted of joe,andrew,evan and me. together we 
        made a good track but we had so many attempts since we did not have 
        enough power for the car to pop the ballon. But in the end we did it
        and it was fun to create.
        
        <p> Week 5 9/18-9/22 <br>
        this week we made boats made out of paper and my design could hold 99.0 <br>
        grams which was a good score in the class but the best was 122 grams<br>
        at the end of class we drew E's and cut them out 
        
        <P> Week 6 9/25-9/29
        This week we dicected a computer with Andrew SInclair. We started by
        taking the cover off and inside it looked so complicated and i thoght
        we could never finish. next we took out everything inside which started 
        with big stuff but then we got down to the wires which were hard to unplug.
        the hardest part was supose to be taking everything out but when 
        we started puting everything back in we realized we had to put something
        under the motherboard so we had to unscrew everything and start over.
        when we were about half way done i had to go to my water polo game 
        but Andrew put it back together and it was super fun and i learn a lot.
        
        <P> Week 7  10/2-10/6
        This week we learned about biomechanics. A big part of biomechanics 
        is prostetics and we learned all about that. next we made a tinkercad 
        design of a prostetic for a animal and i made a leg for a monkey. It was
        very fun and next week we will make a cardboard prostetic hand.
         </p> week 8 10/8-10/12 <br>
         this week i was sick but i learned that we switched seats. 
         then we took a quiz on biomechanics. After that we went over the 
         Aerospace engineering slides and watched a video on space x self landing rocket.
         on thursday we made a tinkercad model of our rocket that we are going to make next week.

</p> week 9 10/24-10/28<br>
I was sick last week so i had to do my tinkercad of my rocked bottle 
on monday but i got that finished so on tuesday I partnered up with dickson
and we bade our model and on thursday we tested our design and it did 
pretty bad and went about 12 feet but it was fun.

        </p> Week 10 10/23-10/27 <br>
        this week we made water filters using rocks pebbles sand and 
        cotton balls. we put all the materials in a plastic bottle,
        it didn't work very well, I belive that it is because there was
        to much sand and it made the water dirty. In the end we did bad but I learned a lot <br>

        </p> week 11 10/30-11/3 <br>
        This week we learned about circut boards. For me this week was hard
        we learned a lot of things and it was hard to remember everything.
        We did 2 labs and the first one took me a while but once i learned how to 
        do it i did the second one easily even though it was harder. On friday
        all we did was Our website and now I am cought up.
        
        </p> Week 12 11/6-11/10 <br>
        This week we had 2 labs that we did in a real circut board. The first one
        was basic and we did it pretty fast. It took us a while to set up our
        arduino and have evrything pluged in and once it was right it didn't work.
        We figured out that our arduino was broken so we got another one and 
        it worked. In the next lab it was hard to set up and we made code but
        even though the code was supose to be right it didn't work. In the end 
        we learned that the last code that was made on the arduino was left there
        so we couldent continue. But I still learned alot and we will try again later.

        </p> Week 13 11/13-11/17 <br>
        This week we finished up on our eletrical engineering lab on monday
        but me and my partner finish last week so we just worked on our website.
        Then on tuesday we started learning about bussness engineering. we learned
        about all types of tricks for making a bussness. on thursday we started
        making a shark tank item and we decided to make a water purifier that 
        makes your sweat into drinking water.
        
        </p> Week 14 11/27-12/1<br>
        This week we changed our product to a Scrub Doggy and worked a lot on monday.
        Then on Tuesday We started presenting but the wifi was booty so we had 
        to move to ms.Petrosian's class room. Me and my group desided to get 
        it over with so we were the second group to present. I was assigned the
        middle part of the slides. I feel good about our presentation and i think
        that we will get a good grade.
        
        </p> s2 week 1 1/8-1/12<br>
        This week we started by learning about chemical engineering and watched
        a video about what people in that field do. IN the video i learned that
        chemical engineering is the designing processes to transport, transform,
        and produce materials. next class we learned the consicity of ooblec and
        made it which was fun. I worked with adrian and at first it was too liquidy
        but by mixing it it became real ooblec which made me happy.
         
        </p> s2 week 2 1/15-1/19<br>
        This week we learned about Mouse trap cars. We started by reaserching about
        them and found out how they work. Next we watched a video about the world
        record and it astonished me. Later we started making our design along with 
        a tinkercad and I started on that and my partner helped me out. 
        And will start on our mouse trap car next week.
        
        </p> s2 week 3 1/22-1/26<br>
        This week we had a slow start with me being alone got left behind. The next day we 
        worked realy hard and got everything caught up. We finished evrything so 
        it was time to build. We started by cutting our cardboard and had our base 
        done by the end of the day
        
        </p> s2 week 4 1/29-2/2<br>
        This week we really stsrted to get it done and by the end of the day we 
        had a full car but we wern't done with the mechanics. Once we finished the 
        mechanics it was time to test. our first try we went very far but we had to 
        place it sideways to get it as far as possible. I think we did good a the only thing 
        we could improve on is making it straghter
       This week
      
        </p> s2 week 5/6 2/5-2/19<br>
       This week we started on our 2nd design. first we thought about what could we 
       do to make everything better. Atatching the pole to the mouse trap was quite
       hard since there was so much tension with the string it was being pushed back. 
       We used glue and tape to attach our pole which worked well enough.
     
        </p> s2 week 7 2/19-2/23<br>
        This week we began testing but first we needed to make a few improvements. We 
        started by continuing our mechanics by just finishing up the pole by making it
        stronger. Then we started testing and our first attempt flew straght to the wall
        and went the furthest in our section. We tried 2 other times but it just wasent
        as good and even in one of them someones car ran straght into mine. At the end 
        of it all it was fun and I learned a lot.
      
        </p> s2 week 8 2/26-3/1<br>
        this week we learned about egg drops and started our project. we started by 
        reaserching and found that the strongest shape is a triange so we desided to 
        make 2 piramids with one on top of the other to protect the egg
        
        </p> s2 week 9 3/4-3/8<br>
        this week we started with a challenge, the challenge was making a paper
        airplane and throwing it as far as we can 
        
        </p> s2 week 10 3/11-3/15<br>
        This week we started with a challenge where we we had a meter stick,
        ruber bands, and popsicle sticks to hold a water ballon for 100 meters.
        even though i worked hard it wasn't stable enough and sliped out early on. 
        later in the week was testing day but we had a bit of time to improve our 
        design by making everything more secure so nothing fell apart. Then we went
        outside to drop and it went smoothly and too easy.
         
        </p> s2 week 11 3/26-3/29
        This week we started a new challenge which was building a boat out of paper 
        We had to choose new partners and i chose Noah since i thought he was smart 
        and would put in enough work. We started with a tinker cad and made our design 
        which functioned with popsicle sticks as the propeler and ruber bands as the 
        moter to spin the sticks. Then we started building on thursday and we decided 
        that Noah will make the moter and ill make the boat. I started by looking up 
        a oragami video and found one that looked relatively easy. It started fine but 
        got harder and harder and in the end i had a compleat boat but it was backwords 
        somehow.
        
        </p> S2 Week 12 4/1-4/5
        this week we scraped our design and started with just a plastic cup. We didn't 
        want our old boat to go in the trash so we took our moter and placed inside our cup.
        There were some things that didnt fit so we instaled some rods to hold everything up 
        and it looked great. When we went out to the gutter and placed out boat in we realized
        that the propeler was to long and could not fit inside. We went back inside and cut it 
        just enough to fit perfectly. The next day we made some finishing touches and it was 
        time to test. Me and Noah were confident and we put our cup in the gutter and loated up 
        our moter and it didn't move an inch.
       
        </p> S2 Week 13 4/8-4/12 
        this week on tuesday we did a challenge where we got 15 post-it notes and had to make a bridge.
        I understood the asignment as make it as long as possible which most people were doing. 
        i chose my partner and started cutting the notes. It took a long time but once we were 
        done cutting it was time to attach them together. It wasn't hard but they kept falling appart.
        later we had to strech it out and put it on a chair. Our bridge was stable until ms. P came
        and it broke. we ended with a grade of 7/10. then on thursday we started are next and final
        assignment of a cardboard boat. I chose my team and we started the tinkercad and chose our 
        leader to be Evan. By the end we all finished the tinkercad and will decide who has the best one.
     
        </p> S2 Week 14 4/15-4/19
        This week we continued the cardboard boat project. We started by building the base and it was 
        great. Then we moved on to the walls and used a lot of tape and made a tight seal so no 
        water could enter. We finished the day by making everything stronger. then on Thursday 
        we brainstormed ideas on what to do and how to make it pretty. we first finished the front 
        and then moved on to the base. Since today we got our new cardboard we used half a peice to 
        double layer the bottom. Diego was making some accessories to make the boat look like
        a hellcat which is what we all want it to look like.
